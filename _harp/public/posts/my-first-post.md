Hello there! This is my first post for the <a href="http://atularvind.github.io" title="atul arvind">atularvind.github.io</a>. Finally I have created a good looking design for my website with lots of learning.

Purpose
-------
Purpose to build this website is so simple, **just to share knowledge**. Knowledge like **Python**, **Postgres**, **Odoo** **tutorial**, **help**, **tips** and **tricks**. 
As a open source influencers I wanted to make this project open source for the world to learn.

Technology
----------
If you my github directory, you will find a simple well managed html file structure. This page is created using the **Harpjs** static site generator, which uses the **jade templates** which is now known as pug.

I made this website responsive using **bootstrap 3** & for better user experiance I used **jQuery**.

Hope all this go great.

Thanks !
